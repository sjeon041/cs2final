# Order Manager

Order Manager is a simple program meant to facilitate taking/processing restaurant orders.

## Installation

Compile the included .cpp/.h files or use the included main.exe to run.

## Usage

This program comes with a functional UI with multiple prompts that prompts a user to input specified numbers or text to control it.
The current iteration of the program stores the orders in memory meaning the program must stay running in order to store the orders.

## Roadmap

Future versions will aim to handle the below list of updates.

Making orders writeable to an external file
Cleaned up UI/UX experience to not require just terminal/cmd
More bugfixes/error catching
